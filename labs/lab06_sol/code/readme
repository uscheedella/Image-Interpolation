In this lab you will first implement serial code which approximates pi in pi.c.
Make and run this code with:
     > make
     > make run

Then you will implement an omp parallel modification of the serial code in pi_omp.c.
Make and run this code with:
     > make omp
     > make run_omp

You can clean your files with:
    > make clean

You can run the scaling study using the bash file scale.sh:
    > bash scale.sh

You can then plot the results using plotScale.py:
    > python3 plotScale.py
